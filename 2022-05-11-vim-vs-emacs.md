# Vim vs. Emacs
This post is not a comparison between Vim and Emacs, nor does it describe which editor might be best. Instead, it's a raw list of simple operations in both Vim and Emacs, and what the keyboard commands are for each operation. For example, tasks like open and closing a file are listed, with the keyboard shortcuts for both. I've written this mainly for myself as a cheat sheet whilst learning to use Emacs, but have published it here in case any body else finds the information structured this way to be useful.

## Basic operations
### Open a file
- Vim: `C-p` (using the `Ctrl-p` plugin)
- Emacs: `C-x C-f`

### Save a file
- Vim: `:w`
- Emacs: `C-x C-s`

### Closing
- Vim: `:q`
- Emacs: `C-x C-c`

## Text editing
### Deleting a line
- Vim: `dd`
- Emacs: `C-S-backspace`

## Window management
### Switching windows
- Vim: `C-w w`
- Emacs: `C-x o`

### Vertical split
- Vim: `C-w v`
- Emacs: `C-x 3`

### Horizontal split
- Vim: `C-w s`
- Emacs: `C-x 2`

### Close current window
- Vim: `C-w c`
- Emacs: `C-x 0`

## Copy and paste
### Copy
- Vim: `y`, or `"+y` to clipboard.
- Emacs: `M-w`

### Paste
- Vim: `p`, or `"+p` from clipboard.
- Emacs: `C-y
