# Work Experience
## Typeform (2024 - present)
### Staff Engineer (Sept '24 - present)
At Typeform I work across the engineering organisation as a leader, architect, consultant, and mentor. In my first six months, I have:

- **Researched & designed a video content export feature;** starting with no knowledge of the product, I extensively researched the architecture, and reviewed existing functionality, before proposing an approach for building this new capability. When this design was implemented, I remained close to the delivery, and helped troubleshoot any architectural difficulties that arose.
- **Consolidated various documentation sources into a few canonical sources of truth;** including distilling a large technology radar into an authoritative golden path, and crowd-sourcing contributions to a set of concise architectural descriptions of core user journeys. 
- **Taken a leading role in the last-mile delivery of a multi-year project;** co-ordinating efforts organisation-wide to launch a multi-region capability.

## Deliveroo (2023 - 2024)
### Staff Platform Engineer [contract] (Nov '23 - Sept '24)
For almost a year, I worked as a Staff Engineer in Deliveroo's AWS platform engineering team. I was primarily focused on Compute (ECS, EKS) and Datastores (mainly RDS Postgres and Aurora).

I helped teams with:

- Initial research and planning for long-term initiatives.
- Detailed technical designs for forthcoming projects.
- Well-documented delivery plans, and hands-on assistance during implementation.

Some of the notable projects I worked on were:

- Introducing a diverse range of instances types into compute clusters in order to reduce wasted compute resources, and reduce the overall cost of EC2.
- Zero-impact maintenance on critical certificate authority changes to RDS.
- Wide-ranging planning for the implementation of a managed datastore service.

Deliveroo have a very strong writing culture, so alongside all of these projects I enjoyed contributing high-quality written research and designs.

## Form3 (2019 - 2023)
### Staff Engineer (Nov '22 - Nov '23)
At the end of 2022, I decided to take a step away from engineering leadership, back into an IC role. I spent a year as a Staff Engineer on a project building payment systems for the US market.

In this staff role, I am was mostly self-led; I sought out any issues in the team's practices or codebases, and tried to help improve them where I could. I often paired up with members of the team to help solve specific problems, or to plan larger programmes of work.

After more than four years at Form3, I decided to spend some time freelancing to gain more experience of different companies at different stages in their growth, and engineering organisations at different levels of maturity.

### Head of International Engineering (Feb '21 - Nov '22)
In 2021, I started working on a new project at Form3 to build out a fresh product line for international payments.

This involved building applications in Golang, AWS infrastructure with Terraform, and a compute platform in Kubernetes.

It also gave me the opportunity to shape how an engineering team could work and grow, and allowed me to introduce good foundations for knowledge sharing, documentation, and asynchronous decision-making.

In this role I:

- Laid the groundwork for three engineering teams to build out a product successfully with high-quality CI pipelines, load testing, observability, and functional testing.
- Provided technical leadership, and project management.
- Led and facilitated design work for future development.
- Advocated and supported asynchronous knowledge sharing, documentation, and decision-making (using PRDs, RFCs, and ADRs).

### Senior Engineer (June '19 - Feb '21)
When I joined Form3, my first role was a member of the scaling and performance team. I spent most of my time working on Golang and Java code bases, and on analysing the performance of a distributed payments processing system.

This involved lots of work with instrumentation (generally Prometheus), as well as working on our in-house load testing tool: [github.com/form3tech-oss/f1](https://github.com/form3tech-oss/f1).

The workloads I was analysing ran on ECS or Kubernetes, and most relied on asynchronous message processing via SQS or NATS.

## CarFinance247 (2016 - 2019)
I joined CarFinance247 as a DevOps engineer to help the team transition from a single monorepo with no automation, to a modern Git-based estate with automated deployments.

Throughout my time at the company, I became a Lead Engineer of a team building systems that interfaced with third parties, and then Head of Engineering.

In the role of Head of Engineering, I led five engineering teams, and a data science team. I was heavily involved with the start of a new lender--247Money--and worked closely with the data science team to build effective credit scoring machine learning models, using a DevOps approach.

## Galleria (2014 - 2016)
I joined Galleria as a Junior Engineer, and worked on .NET desktop applications. I spent most of my time at the company working on a back-end space optimisation algorithm.

## Capita (2012 - 2014)
My role at Capita was an MI Analyst, which mainly involved analysing data in Excel. As a keen amateur programmer, I used VBA extensively to automate Excel operations, and wrote a number of small VB.NET and C# front-ends to databases.

## Teaching (2010 - 2011)
Prior to my technology career, I trained and worked as a secondary school Physics teacher.
