## [Remapping modifier keys on a Mac, for Linux](./2023-02-19-xmodmap-for-mac.md)
A description of how I remapped some modifier keys on a Macbook Air running Linux. I swapped `cmd` and `ctrl`, fixed right `alt`, and made `h``j``k``l` behave like arrow keys when caps lock is held.

## [PKI certificate management](./2022-07-06-pki-certificate-management.md)
I have a rough understanding of PKI certificates, how they work, and what TLS is
in general. However, I've always struggled to understand the details,
particularly from the point of view of an operator. How do I check if a
certificate is valid? How do I check who issued it? What does it even mean to
"issue" a certificate? In this blog post I try to cover some of these details,
and lift the shroud of confusion that has always surrounded these topics for me.

## [Linux fundamentals](./2022-04-20-linux-fundamentals.md)
The Linux kernel has always held a mystical place in my mind. It's the inner sanctum of computer magic which makes programs work. Somehow. In this post I try to suummarise some of the big ideas about the Linux kernel, including what the kernel does, user/kernel space, and the syscalls API surface.

## [Network Address Translation and Proxies](./2022-03-16-nat-and-proxies.md)
I've always found NAT, forward proxies, and reverse proxies to be somewhat mystical, and I've never understood the fundamentals of how each technique works. This post tries to distil each idea into a simple form, and provides Go code examples where possible.

## [De-mystifiying i3](2020-02-18-demystifying-i3.md)
I've been using Linux for a couple of years but have always struggled to understand i3, Compton and how some Linux users make me feel like I'm still using Windows! Having finally made the switch from Gnome to i3, this post explains each of the technologies in turn as I understand them - in simple terms!
