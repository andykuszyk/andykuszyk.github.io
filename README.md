## [How I write technical documents](2025-04-11-how-i-write-technical-documents.md)
I was recently talking with a colleague about how to write technical documents, and they asked me if I had any tips. Although I enjoy writing technical documents (e.g. design documents), I'm by no means an expert. I shared my thoughts with my colleague, and they found them valuable, so here they are in written form&#x2013;my favourite medium!

## [Dealing with imposter syndrome as a software engineer](2025-02-07-dealing-with-imposter-syndrome.md)
I was recently speaking with a colleague who was explaining how they often work on tasks that require technical knowledge they don't have. I told them that this was a familiar experience to me, and that I frequently feel "out of my depth"! In this post, I explain some of the ways I deal with this, and remain confident and productive when learning new technologies.

## [Entering GPG passphrases with Emacs when signing commits with GPG](./2025-01-10-commit-signing-with-gpg-and-emacs.md)
I recently set-up commit signing with Git for the first time since I've been using Magit in Emacs as my daily-driver Git client. It turns out, if you use a passphrase for your GPG keys, it's a little tricky to setup Emacs as the pinentry client for entering passphrases. I've written down what I did to get this working in the hopes that it will save my future self (and perhaps you!) the effort of finding out how to do it.

## [Running parameterised Jenkins jobs using the Jenkins CLI](./2024-12-05-jenkins-cli.md)
I have used Jenkins on-and-off for many years, but have never really been a power-user. I recently started using it a lot more, and needed to trigger parameterised jobs regularly with a variety of different parameter configurations. Doing this through the UI quickly became cumbersome, and I thought to myself: *there must be a better way!*

It turns out, there is! In this post I explain how to set-up and use the Jenkins CLI, to make working with your builds from a terminal nice and ergonomic.

## [Hypothesis-driven debugging](./2024-11-29-hypothesis-driven-debugging.md)
Several years ago, I spent some time investigating performance problems in a large distributed system. After a while, I noticed that I was using something akin to the scientific method to track down the root causes. In this post, I explain how to use hypotheses--specifically *falsifiable* hypotheses--to debug problems in software systems.

## [My three phases of onboarding as a staff engineer](./2024-11-12-my-three-phases-of-onboarding.md)
I recently joined [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) as a staff engineer, which marked the third time in as many years that I've either joined a new company, or joined a new team, in this type of role. It's my experience that onboarding as a staff engineer is different to onboarding in other types of engineering roles, and I've noticed that I go three distinct phases of onboarding when I start out in this type of role. In this post, I describe my three phases, and offer some practical examples of how I navigate each one.

## [Debugging phantom 400 responses](./2024-10-11-debugging-phantom-400-responses.md)
I recently spent an entire week debugging an unusual situation involving unexplained, intermittent 400 responses to seemingly well-formed HTTP requests. Throughout the week, I tried a variety of things to debug the situation, pulled out more than a little of my hair, and finally stumbled across the solution.

## [Where do all the senior engineers go?](2024-10-04-where-do-all-they-senior-engineers-go.md)

Earlier in my career, I wondered where all the senior engineers went in technology companies. There didn't seem to be that many in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. Now I'm a little more experienced, I think I've spotted where a lot of them end up.

## [Editing encrypted files in Emacs](./2024-08-29-editing-encrypted-files-in-emacs.md)
I routinely store note files in Git repos, and use Emacs' native GPG support to encrypt and decrypt sensitive files. In this post I explain how I create and distribute GPG encryption keys, and how I configure Emacs to make the process as ergonomic as possible.

## [A practical checklist for building distributed systems](./2024-06-28-practical-checklist-for-distributed-systems.md)
During a period when I was designing a new payments system, I worked with several teams of engineers to design new components in a highly distributed system. As we iterated on our design process, we created a checklist of ideas to consider when designing a new part of the system. In this blog post, I talk through each of the items on our checklist, and why we thought it was an important topic to consider when designing new distributed systems.

This is the third of my follow-up posts about [bootstrapping a successful engineering organisation](./2023-03-15-bootstrapping-an-engineering-organisation.md). In this post, I go into more detail about one way to secure engineering access to your environments from day one; in a way that will scale with the size of both your team, and your estate.

## [Using multiple SSH keys for git authentication](./2023-11-23-using-multiple-ssh-keys-for-git-authentication.md)
Although I've been vaguely aware this was possible for many years, I only recently had the need to authenticate with multiple GitHub accounts via SSH from the same machine. In this post, I summarise how to make use of multiple git SSH identities from the same host, with some easy-to-manage configuration tips.

This is the second of my follow-up posts about [bootstrapping a successful engineering organisation](./2023-03-15-bootstrapping-an-engineering-organisation.md). In this post, I discuss the importance of documenting decisions from early-on, and describe a framework I've found useful for structuring problem-solving and design discussions as engineering teams grow.

## [Bootstrapping a successful engineering organisation (1/8)](./2023-03-15-bootstrapping-an-engineering-organisation.md)
I've been reflecting on the most important things to get right when bootstrapping a new engineering organisation, particuarly by thinking about what must have gone well when [Form3](https://www.form3.tech) was founded. This is the first of several posts describing what some of the major challenges might be, and how I think they can be solved.

## [Migrating project v2 boards in GitHub](./2023-02-01-migrating-projectv2-boards.md)

## [What I learned from starting a new project](./2022-10-19-what-i-learned-from-a-new-project.md)
I have spent almost the last two years working on a large, greenfield project first as the lead engineer, and now as the head of engineering. I've learnt a lot about how to grow engineering teams, and build complex systems in this time. This blog post summarises some of my key learnings.

## [PKI certificate management](./2022-07-06-pki-certificate-management.md)
I have a rough understanding of PKI certificates, how they work, and what TLS is
in general. However, I've always struggled to understand the details,
particularly from the point of view of an operator. How do I check if a
certificate is valid? How do I check who issued it? What does it even mean to
"issue" a certificate? In this blog post I try to cover some of these details,
and lift the shroud of confusion that has always surrounded these topics for me.

## [Linux fundamentals](./2022-04-20-linux-fundamentals.md)
The Linux kernel has always held a mystical place in my mind. It's the inner sanctum of computer magic which makes programs work. Somehow. In this post I try to suummarise some of the big ideas about the Linux kernel, including what the kernel does, user/kernel space, and the syscalls API surface.

## [Network Address Translation and Proxies](./2022-03-16-nat-and-proxies.md)
