* Entering GPG passphrases with Emacs when signing commits with GPG
I recently set-up commit signing with Git for the first time since I've been using Magit in Emacs as my daily-driver Git client. It turns out, if you use a passphrase for your GPG keys, it's a little tricky to setup Emacs as the pinentry client for entering passphrases. I've written down what I did to get this working in the hopes that it will save my future self (and perhaps you!) the effort of finding out how to do it.
** DONE Step -1: setting up your GPG key
In order to sign Git commits with GPG, you'll need a GPG key:

#+begin_src bash :results output verbatim :tangle temp.bash
gpg --full-generate-key
#+end_src

Be sure to set a passphrase! ðŸ”’

Next, you'll probably need to export the public key and let your Git forge (e.g. GitHub) know about it. List your keys:

#+begin_src bash :results output verbatim :tangle temp.bash
$ gpg --list-keys
[keyboxd]
---------
pub   ed25519 2380-10-01 [SC]
      53467HJGRGHJFYH438756YUTR784365785YUIHYJ
uid           [ultimate] Jim Kirk <jim.kirkg@starfleet.com>
sub   cv25519 2380-10-01 [E]
#+end_src

And then use the key ID to export it in plain-text:

#+begin_src bash :results output verbatim :tangle temp.bash
$ gpg --export --armor 53467HJGRGHJFYH438756YUTR784365785YUIHYJ
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
...
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
#+end_src
** DONE Step 0: setting up Git
Next, you'll want to enable commit signing automatically:

#+begin_src bash :results output verbatim :tangle temp.bash
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
#+end_src

And tell Git which key to use:

#+begin_src bash :results output verbatim :tangle temp.bash
git config --global user.signingkey 53467HJGRGHJFYH438756YUTR784365785YUIHYJ
#+end_src

Now, if you try to commit from a terminal you should be prompted for your passphrase. If you're not, you're probably missing this environment variable in your shell's =.rc= file:

#+begin_src bash :results output verbatim :tangle temp.bash
export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
#+end_src
** DONE Step 1: Emacs as a =pinentry= client
Alright, now that you've got commit signing setup, what we actually need to do is configure Emacs to a be a =pinentry= client.

First, make sure you've got it installed. For Mac OS, run:

#+begin_src bash :results output verbatim :tangle temp.bash
brew install pinentry
#+end_src

Next, in Emacs, install the client package:

#+begin_src elisp :results none
(use-package pinentry :ensure t)
(pinentry-start)
#+end_src

Finally, configure GPG to use Emacs. Put this in you =gpg-agent.conf= file, which for me is at =~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf=:

#+begin_src conf
allow-emacs-pinentry
#+end_src

Enjoy passphrase-protected commit signing! ðŸŽŠ
