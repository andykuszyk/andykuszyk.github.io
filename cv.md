# Work Experience
## Form3 (2019 - present)
### Staff Engineer (Nov '22 - present)
At the end of 2022, I decided to take a step away from engineering management, back into an IC role. I am now a Staff Engineer on a project building payment systems for the US market.

As a Staff Engineer, I am mostly self-led; I seek out any issues in the team's practices or codebases, and try to help improve them where I can. I often pair up with members of the team to help solve specific problems, or to plan larger programmes of work.

### Head of International Engineering (Feb '21 - Nov '22)
In 2021, I started working on a new project at Form3 to build out a fresh product line for international payments.

This involved building applications in Golang, AWS infrastructure with Terraform, and a compute platform in Kubernetes.

It also gave me the opportunity to shape how an engineering team could work and grow, and allowed me to introduce good foundations for knowledge sharing, documentation, and asynchronous decision-making.

In this role I:

- Laid the groundwork for three engineering teams to build out a product successfully with high-quality CI pipelines, load testing, observability, and functional testing.
- Provided technical leadership, and project management.
- Led and facilitated design work for future development.
- Advocated and supported asynchronous knowledge sharing, documentation, and decision-making (using PRDs, RFCs, and ADRs).

### Senior Engineer (June '19 - Feb '21)
When I joined Form3, my first role was a member of the scaling and performance team. I spent most of my time working on Golang and Java code bases, and on analysing the performance of a distributed payments processing system.

This involved lots of work with instrumentation (generally Prometheus), as well as working on our in-house load testing tool: [github.com/form3tech-oss/f1](https://github.com/form3tech-oss/f1).

The workloads I was analysing ran on ECS or Kubernetes, and most relied on asynchronous message processing via SQS or NATS.

## CarFinance247 (2016 - 2019)
I joined CarFinance247 as a DevOps engineer to help the team transition from a single monorepo with no automation, to a modern Git-based estate with automated deployments.

Throughout my time at the company, I became a Lead Engineer of a team building systems that interfaced with third parties, and then Head of Engineering.

In the role of Head of Engineering, I led five engineering teams, and a data science team. I was heavily involved with the start of a new lender--247Money--and worked closely with the data science team to build effective credit scoring machine learning models, using a DevOps approach.

## Galleria (2014 - 2016)
I joined Galleria as a Junior Engineer, and worked on .NET desktop applications. I spent most of my time at the company working on a back-end space optimisation algorithm.

## Capita (2012 - 2014)
My role at Capita was an MI Analyst, which mainly involved analysing data in Excel. As a keen amateur programmer, I used VBA extensively to automate Excel operations, and wrote a number of small VB.NET and C# front-ends to databases.

## Teaching (2010 - 2011)
Prior to my technology career, I trained and worked as a secondary school Physics teacher.
