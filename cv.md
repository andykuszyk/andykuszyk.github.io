# Andy Kuszyk CV
## About Me
I am an experienced software engineer, with almost a decade of experience working in Golang, Terraform, Python and .NET. 

I have worked with privately hosted servers, private clouds hosted in data centres, and public cloud providers. 

I practice DevOps as a matter of course.

I'm an enthusiastic Vim and Emacs user, love Linux, and can't work without a tiling window manager!

You can read more about me on my technology blog: https://andykuszyk.github.io.

## Primary Skills
- Application development in Golang, and Python.
- Infrastructure development in Terraform.
- Platform design with AWS and Kubernetes.
- Telemetry management with the Prometheus and ELK stacks.

# Work Experience
## Form3 (2019 - present)
### Head of International Engineering (Dec '21 - present)
I am currently the Head of Engineering for a department building international payment systems. The department consists of three engineering teams of around six engineers each, working across two projects.

In this role I:

- Provide technical leadership, and project management.
- Lead and facilitate design work for future development.
- Advocate and support asynchronous knowledge sharing, documentation, and decision-making (ADRs/RFCs).

### Lead Engineer (Feb '21 - Dec '21)
In 2021, I started working on a new project at Form3 to build out a fresh product line for international payments.

This involved building applications in Golang, AWS infrastructure with Terraform, and a compute platform in Kubernetes.

It also gave me the opportunity to shape how an engineering team could work and grow, and allowed me to introduce good foundations for knowledge sharing, documentation, and asynchronous decision-making.

### Senior Engineer (June '19 - Feb '21)
When I joined Form3, my first role was a member of the scaling and performance team. I spent most of my time working on Golang and Java code bases, and on analysing the performance of a distributed payments processing system.

This involved lots of work with instrumentation (generally Prometheus), as well as working on our in-house load testing tool (https://github.com/form3tech-oss/f1).

The workloads I was analysing ran on ECS or Kubernetes, and most relied on asynchronous message processing via SQS or NATS.

## CarFinance247 (2016 - 2019)
I joined CarFinance247 as a DevOps engineer to help the team transition from a single monorepo with no automation, to a modern Git-based estate with automated deployments.

Throughout my time at the company, I became a Lead Engineer of a team building systems that interfaced with third parties, and then Head of Engineering.

In the role of Head of Engineering, I led five engineering teams, and a data science team. I was heavily involved with the start of a new lender--247Money--and worked closely with the data science team to build effective credit scoring machine learning models, using a DevOps approach.

## Galleria (2014 - 2016)
I joined Galleria as a Junior Engineer, and worked on .NET desktop applications. I spent most of my time at the company working on a back-end space optimisation algorithm.

## Capita (2012 - 2014)
My role at Capita was an MI Analyst, which mainly involved analysing data in Excel. As a keen amateur programmer, I used VBA extensively to automate Excel operations, and wrote a number of small VB.NET and C# front-ends to databases.

## Teaching (2010 - 2011)
Prior to my technology career, I trained and worked as a secondary school Physics teacher.

# Education
- MSc in Advanced Computer Science (MMU, 2016 - 2018)
- QTS in Secondary Education (University of Reading, 2010 - 2011)
- BSc in Physics (University of Reading, 2005 - 2008)
