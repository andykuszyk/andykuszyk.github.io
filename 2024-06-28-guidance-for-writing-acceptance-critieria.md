# Some simple guidance for writing good acceptance criteria


## Introduction

I've [previously written](2022-10-19-what-i-learned-from-a-new-project.md) about the benefits of writing good acceptance criteria, and how it helps create the conditions for teams of engineers to self-organise. I've noticed that sometimes good acceptance criteria can be elusive, and that writing them well takes practice. I recently shared some tips for writing acceptance criteria with a team I'm working with, so I thought I would re-post them here in case anyone else finds them useful.


## âœ… Good acceptance criteria should&#x2026;

-   List individual, specific outcomes that should be achieved when the task is complete.
-   Indicate to the assignee how they will know when they've finished the task.
-   Preferably be in a bulleted list, with a specific outcome per item.
-   Outline the scope of the task (i.e. what is or isn't expected).
-   Be self-explanatory to someone whose only context was gained from reading the task description itself.


## â›” If you're writing acceptance criteria, you should avoid&#x2026;

-   Describing the aim of the task; this is important, but should be clear from the rest of the description.
-   Providing context for the task; this is important, but should have it's own section.
-   Detailing exactly how the task should be implemented; the acceptance criteria should outline the boundaries of the task, without being prescriptive about the implementation.
-   Explaining why the task is being worked on; this should be included elsewhere in the description.


## ðŸ’­ When you're writing acceptance criteria, ask yourself&#x2026;

*"Will the person reading this achieve the outcomes I expect if the complete all of the acceptance criteria?"*
